Giampaolo44 is Giampaolo Ferradini  


You may find here things that come from several different spaces explored, including but not limited to:  
* Entrepreneurship & startups (after all I am a startupper: [KJuicer][tag-KJ])  
* Finance & startups (being an ex-banker gives me an interesting vantage point on the subject, and I often act as an advisor)  
* Spirituality (apparently the above did not stop me from being a mystic)  
* Politics & activism (watch and sometimes act)  
* Programming (ehm... let's say that I might take notes on how I get along with handling this website, ok?)
